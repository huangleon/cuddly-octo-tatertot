Cannot connect to samba shared files after 4.1.14-1 upgrade.

See https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1484501#p1484501 for some log comparisons between 4.1.13 and 4.1.14 taken moments apart and some cursory debugging. The problem is not so easily worked around for windows clients.

EDIT: Looked at the upstream patch found at "http://samba.org/samba/ftp/patches/patch-4.1.13-4.1.14.diffs.gz" and found that they changed how the "smb_my_netbios_names" array is allocated in "samba-4.1.14/source3/lib/util_names.c" and must have broke "is_myname(cstring)". It's an upstream bug for sure.

EDIT2: Super simple workaround! Just shorten your NETBIOS name by adding "netbios name=[15 chars or less, simple ASCII chars only]" to your smb.conf.

EDIT3: Reported upstream: https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11008

Algorithms, 3 features:
    1. Finite.
    2. Deterministic.
    3. Effective

Recursion:
    1. Has base case
    2. Address subproblems *smaller*.
    3. Address subproblems not overlapped.

Definition of division and remainder:
a / b, a % b
Quotient a / b rounds toward 0;
Remainder a % b defined such that (a / b) * b + a % b is always equal to a.
(Watch out for negative integer):
-14 % 3 is -2
14 % -3 is 2

Hallmark of object-oriented programming: Encapsulation, encapsulate everything(data types/method) within implementation.

Autoboxing, Autounboxing:
Java provides mechanism of conversion between reference and its corresponding primitive types:
Integer/int, Long/long...

Scientific Method
1. Observe
2. Hypothesize a model
3. Predict events using the hypothesis
4. Verify predictions by making further observation
5. Validate by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree.
